		<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12 col-xs" , id="p3"> <div style="text-align: right; margin-bottom: 10px;">SUSHI</div>
		It's a Japanese style of food that uses fish (raw or cooked), vegetables, and is often combined with rice that's been seasoned with vinegar. Lemon, Pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce are usually served on the side. This is the traditional way to roll any type of rolled sushi, which is called maki sushi. There are actually two options for this method: rolling with the sushi rice on top of the sheet of nori, as we do here; or with the nori flipped over so the rice ends up on the outside of the finished roll (uramaki sushi).</div>
